# Vagrant

## Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer

Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer - having a virtual machine (VM) is the perfect tool for that.

Also:

- This project is **100% optional**

* This project **can’t be done in Sandboxes** - it can be done only in your local computer.

## Resources
